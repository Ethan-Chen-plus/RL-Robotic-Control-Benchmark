# RL-Robotic-Control-Benchmark

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and supporting documentation for the research paper "Title of Your Paper". Our work presents a comprehensive study on the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms in robotic control within physical environments, using stm32f103 and Raspberry Pi platforms as a novel benchmark.

## Features
- Implementation of RL and DRL algorithms for robotic control.
- Custom simulation environment based on OpenAI Gym's Pendulum task.
- Integration code for stm32f103 and Raspberry Pi hardware interface.
- Detailed experimental setup for real-world robotic control tasks.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Gym
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the algorithm's implementation)
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 3/4, stm32f103 microcontroller, L298N motor driver module, DC gear motor (TT motor), and other components as listed in the appendix of the paper.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RL-Robotic-Control-Benchmark.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Detailed instructions on running the simulation and deploying the algorithms on the hardware setup are provided in the `docs` folder.

## Experiment and Results
Our benchmark showcases the effectiveness of RL and DRL algorithms in controlling the direction and speed of a DC gear motor in real-world settings. The results, along with comparative analysis, are extensively discussed in the paper.
